# FORGELINE

**Build. Supply. Conquer.**

FORGELINE is a large-scale real-time strategy game where industrial production, logistics, intelligence, and direct battlefield command form one interconnected war machine.

The project is built on **ForgeLine Engine**, a custom C#/.NET RTS engine designed specifically for large-scale, deterministic-friendly simulation. It is not intended to become a general-purpose game engine.

## Technical Baseline

- C# 14
- .NET 10 LTS
- Windows x64 as the initial client platform
- Direct3D 12 as the planned initial graphics backend
- data-oriented, ECS-first architecture
- fixed-tick, headless-capable simulation
- custom job system
- chunk-based world model
- hierarchical RTS navigation
- graph-based logistics simulation
- strict simulation/presentation separation
- multiplayer-aware architecture with networking deferred

The repository foundation intentionally contains architecture and infrastructure only. Gameplay systems, rendering, navigation algorithms, logistics simulation, combat, editor functionality, asset conversion, and networking are not implemented by the foundation.

## Repository Layout

```text
src/          Engine, simulation, game, presentation, client, and headless projects
tools/        FORGELINE-specific editor and compiler hosts
tests/        Unit and simulation-oriented test projects
benchmarks/   Performance benchmark hosts
build/        Repository validation and future build-support scripts
docs/         Architecture and development documentation
.github/      Continuous integration workflows
```

## Prerequisites

Install the .NET SDK version selected by `global.json`.

The current foundation targets .NET SDK **10.0.401**.

## Restore

```powershell
dotnet restore ForgeLine.sln
```

## Validate Architecture

```powershell
pwsh ./build/Validate-ProjectReferences.ps1
```

This validates the project-reference graph, rejects circular references, and enforces key simulation and headless dependency boundaries.

## Build

```powershell
dotnet build ForgeLine.sln --configuration Release
```

## Test

```powershell
dotnet test ForgeLine.sln --configuration Release
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmark projects are present as compilation-ready BenchmarkDotNet hosts. Concrete engine benchmarks are added with the systems they measure.

Example:

```powershell
dotnet run --project benchmarks/ForgeLine.Ecs.Benchmarks/ForgeLine.Ecs.Benchmarks.csproj --configuration Release
```

## Architecture

See [Architecture](docs/Architecture.md) for project responsibilities and dependency rules.

See [Development](docs/Development.md) for the canonical development and validation workflow.
